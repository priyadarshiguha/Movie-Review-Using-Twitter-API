# Movie-Review-Using-Twitter-API

In this example we are trying to determine the overall public review of a movie by analysing latest tweets and movie reviews by Twitter users.

The Twitter API and Python libraries tweepy and textblob are used to retrieve and analyse public tweets to determine how the audience feels about it. The Tweets are then analysed and categorized into three categories- Positive, Negative and Neutral. The final result is displayed using a pie graph.
